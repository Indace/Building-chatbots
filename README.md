A chatbot is a computer program, which responds like a smart entity when conversed with through text or voice and understands one or more human languages by Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here, we will build chatbots using two different frameworks, the nltk.chat package and the Rasa framework. The first recipe talks about the nltk.chat package,  where we build a simple keyword matching chatbot, and the rest of the chapter is devoted 
to Rasa. Rasa is a complex framework that allows the creation of very sophisticated chatbots, and we will have a basic introduction to it. We will build a default bot using Rasa, and then we will modify it to do simple interactions.

We will cover these points : 

• Building a basic chatbot with keyword matching
• Building a basic Rasa chatbot
• Creating question-answer pairs with Rasa
• Creating and visualizing conversation paths with Rasa
• Creating actions for the Rasa chatbot
